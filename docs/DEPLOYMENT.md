# BigotBot Deployment To-Do List

## 1. Remove Firebase
- [ ] Delete all Firebase-related code, config files, and dependencies
- [ ] Remove `firebase.ts` and any Firebase imports/usages in your codebase
- [ ] Delete Firebase project from the Firebase console (optional, for security)
- [ ] Remove Firebase environment variables from `.env.local` and documentation
- [ ] Uninstall Firebase packages (`npm uninstall firebase`)

## 2. Integrate Clerk (Authentication & Payments)
- [ ] Sign up and create a project in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
- [ ] Install Clerk for Next.js (`npm install @clerk/nextjs`)
- [ ] Add Clerk environment variables to `.env.local` (from Clerk dashboard):
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - [ ] `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Wrap your app with `ClerkProvider` in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- [ ] Add Clerk's SignIn/SignUp components to your auth pages
- [ ] Protect routes using Clerk's hooks/components (`useAuth`, `SignedIn`, `SignedOut`)
- [ ] Enable and configure payments in Clerk (connect Stripe in Clerk dashboard)
- [ ] Use Clerk's billing components or APIs for payment flows

## 3. Clean Up Documentation & Environment Variables
- [ ] Update `DOCUMENTATION.md` and any other docs to reflect Clerk usage (remove Firebase references)
- [ ] Remove unused environment variables from `.env.local`
- [ ] Document all required environment variables and where to get them
- [ ] Ensure all API keys and secrets are secure and not committed to version control

## 4. Prepare for Deployment
- [ ] Set up production environment variables (get Clerk keys for production)
- [ ] Test authentication and payment flows in production mode locally (`npm run build && npm start`)
- [ ] Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy your app and verify all features work (auth, payments, voice, etc.)
- [ ] Set up custom domain and SSL if needed
- [ ] Monitor logs and error reporting for issues

## 5. App Store Submission Checklist
- [ ] If deploying as a web app (PWA):
  - [ ] Ensure PWA compliance (manifest, icons, offline support)
  - [ ] Test on mobile devices
  - [ ] Follow [App Store guidelines for PWAs](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)
- [ ] If wrapping as a native app (e.g., with Expo or Capacitor):
  - [ ] Build native binaries (iOS/Android)
  - [ ] Test thoroughly on real devices
  - [ ] Prepare app store assets (screenshots, description, privacy policy, etc.)
  - [ ] Submit to Apple App Store/Google Play Store

**Tip:**
- [ ] Keep your documentation and environment variables up to date as you make changes
- [ ] Double-check all authentication and payment flows before going live
- [ ] Reach out if you need code examples or help with any specific step!
